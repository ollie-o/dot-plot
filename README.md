How to run this:

1. Open the Terminal,
2. Navigate to the directory where `dot_plot.py` is,
3. Run `python3 dot_plot.py`.

You may need to install packages first. You'll do that with `pip`:

```
# Set up a virtual environment as the place where you install the
# packages (optional but recommended)
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install the packages
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
